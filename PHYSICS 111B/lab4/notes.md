- Cubes perform the measurement, only let in horizontally polarized light. 
- To calibrate phase offset and HWP on the beam side: set both measurement HWPs to 0, turn the beam HWP s.t.
  coincidence count is maximized --> 100% horizontally polarized light. Then adjust phase offset so that
  counts are maximized. 
    - Don't touch the phase offset after this point. 
    - Phase offset: 308.5 degrees. 
- Laser-side HWP max (purely horizontal light): 27 degrees. 
- Maximum count for measurement HWP: 1 deg for A, 295 for B. 

Expect the counts to follow some sort of sine curve, the beam splitter really is just a projection onto the
horizontal axis.  

- Calculated contrast for arms A and B, got roughly equal numbers. Equal numbers lets you conclude that the
  hh and vv states are roughly equal, so the polarization angle of the laser before entering the BBOs is 45
  degrees.      



Offset on HWP 1: 271
Offset on HWP 2: 207
