# Debate 1 Notes

## Pro-ban opening statement
* Octopus farming is highly unsustainable (requires lots of resources)
  * risk of overfishing
  * put lots of pressure on fisheries to fish more - causing a decline in resources
  * there needs to be a scaling back 
* Farming also harms wildlife surrounding the area
* Doesn't contribute to food security


### Ethical Argument
* Octopuses are sentient beings, so they're very difficult to farm
* Octopuses satisfy 7/8 of the criteria for sentience
  * They can make decisions based on information (e.g. understanding opportunity cost)
  * It can learn 
  * **Overall conclusion is that they're sentient, and thus shouldn't be farmed**
* Octopuses are also social animals, so they get frustrated when things don't go their way

## Con-team opening statement
* We don't know many things about the octopus, and thus we can't fully define them as sentient beings
* we don't know for sure whether octopuses are sentient
* There needs to be more research here before we make a ban 
* Octopus farms are essential for research purposes. 
* Factory farming of octopuses isn't exactly special *problem with this is that they're sentient*
  * Many other seafoods that we eat are all factory farmed in some way
  * As demand continues to grow can lead to stress placed on the seaside communities
  * Octopus farming could increase revenue
* The problem is a cognitive dissonance - we farm cattle and pigs, whose intelligence has been measured, yet we're against octopus farming.
  

## Pro Rebuttal
* When ethical advances do occur, it might already be too late
* It's difficult to keep octopuses because of the high intensive that they require
* Just because we factory farm cattle and pigs doesn't mean that we have to factory farm octopuses as well  


## Con rebuttal
* Octopuses have a high reproduction rate, and along with other factors this makes octopus farming is easy 
* There's a job crisis in the sense that octopus farming could give fishermen another chance


## Closing arguments - Pro
* Because it's a luxury good it's not entirely necessary to farm octopuses
* They have been capable of conscious experience (i.e. they're sentient)
  * they're able to feel pain and suffering, and be able to dream 
* Do we want to take that ethical risk, knowing that we don't know the amount of suffering we are putting on animals?


## Closing arguments - Con
* We can use octopus to explore the concept of consciousness
* Farmers and scientists are actively learning from them
* Increasing the demand of octopus without damaging wildlife
* By banning octopus farming we miss the opporutnity to input regulations that would allow for more ethical and sustainable ways of farming
* Not resistant to domestic farming, what makes pigs and cows different from octopus?
* There are parts of the world that consume octopus more than others
  * There are cultures who consume octopus as a part of their main diet
* **General idea: using octopus farming as a way to learn about the conscious mind**
