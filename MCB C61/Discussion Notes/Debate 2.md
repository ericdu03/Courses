# Technology and mental performance

Personally, I stand against the debate statement. This is mainly because while I partially agree with the statement that such technology does hinder our ability to perform some complex actions, I also think the same technology (or derivatives of it) have helped us understand others to a significantly deeper level than we could have otherwise.

Take calculators for instance: because they are significantly are more accurate, computationally faster, and also easy to use, I never really felt the need to compute any operations manually. This is especially true when we consider large numbers, since the calculator will output the correct result significantly faster than I could ever imagine computing with pen and paper.

However, these calculators and their computing power are also the reason that we understand concepts that would otherwise be nearly impossible to verify. In astrophysics, for instance, simulations of the universe are compared with empirical observations in order to evaluate the accuracy of our current physical models. (Chu, 2022) Without the invention of supercomputers (which are basically glorified calculators) that facilitate such simulations, we would not know whether our theory was right. Thus, the calculator, in this regard, has deepend our understandings of the universe and faciliated complex thought, as opposed to having a negative impact on it.

This is one of the many examples where calculators and the invention of "brute force" computation has helped us develop a deeper understanding of certain subjects, thus having a positive impact on our ability to perform complex thought.
