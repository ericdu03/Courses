The "online brain": how the internet may be changing our cognition https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502424/

This article was one of the more influential articles I came across during my reading, and I used it quite extensively to craft my opening statement for this debate. It is directly relevant to the topic at hand as it specifically has a section discussing the impacts of readily accessible information on memory, which is one of the topics outlined in the debate prompt. It also discusses how the internet may be altering our attentional capacities, which is also outlined in our debate prompt, under mental performance. Of course, the reliability of this source does not need much scrutiny as it is a paper published into an academic journal, so it is likely a credible source.

This article was also equally as influential in expanding upon the idea of multitasking and attention span. This article is relevant to the debate as it discusses the idea that multitasking is detrimental and leads to reduced productivity since our brain is constantly jumping between trying to complete two different tasks at once, which is related to mental performance and complex thought. The source also appears to be quite reliable, as it provides links to the academic studies themselves, and upon taking a very brief glance at them they seem to summarize these studies relatively well.
