Personally, I do not support octopus farming, and perhaps the most compelling reason is the fact that I do not support the mass exploitation and farming of other animals for our personal benefit. 

Firstly, I don't support the mass slaughtering and mass farming of animals like chicken, cows and pigs either. Whenever my family goes grocery shopping, we aim to buy meats (and other products derived from animals) that are sourced from free-range animals as opposed to mass-farmed ones, despite the latter being half as expensive. We do this not only because the free-range option tends to be of higher quality, but more importantly because we don't want to support the large corporations who exploit the well being of animals in the interest of a cost-efficient method to deliver products to the general public. However, these mass slaughterhouses are a a necessary evil in order to provide the world with enough food. Despite the fact that these slaughterhouses completely neglect the well being of the animals being farmed like chicken and cattle, they are a necessary evil that must be done in order to guarantee that everybody has access to secure, trustworthy food.

Octopus, on the other hand, is not an animal that is caught to solve the problems of food insecurity, but instead is enjoyed as an exotic delicacy in many parts of the world. Thus, the farming of octopus simply increases the availability of this food to a wider audience, and as a result is not exactly a necessary practice that needs to be implemented. Furthermore, octopus farming is incredibly damaging for the health of an octopus, as they could experience boredom and frustration, which has ultimately been shown to increase mortality rates. (Dunphy-Daly, 2020) Alongside this, there are also some large logistical challenges that must be overcome when octopus farming, namely the amoutn of resources required to raise an octopus. Because they eat more then three-times their body weight in food over thier lifetime, it puts immense pressure on the seafood industry to, alongside the general public, produce enough food to raise these octopuses. 

To conclude, I do not support the mass farming of octopuses, primarily due to reasons concerning the well-being of the octopuses, as well as the logistical problems which could potentially undermine the seafood industry's ability to provide enough food for humans.
