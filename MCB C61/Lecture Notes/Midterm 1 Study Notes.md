# MCB C61 Midterm Study Notes

## Exam Information

* Exam will be open book, open note
  * You can google but it might not be to your benefit because the answers you get will be more complicated than what is required (and thus will be marked wrong)
* 80 Minutes, 24 hour window to take it

## Discussion Notes

* Sympathetic vs Parasympathetic nervous system

These are are the different "states" that the human body can be in, based on the situation. 

* **Sympathetic:** Fight or flight
  * increase heart rate
  * decrease gastrointestinal motility (you really don't need to process food in fight or flight)
* **Parasympathetic:** "Rest and Digest"
  * Lowering blood pressure
  * constrict pupils (you don't need much information when you're resting)
  * constrict airways (same logic as previous one)
  * stimulate bladder
    * this does not refer to the reflex you get during fight or flight but more to "going the bathroom"


## Parasympathomimetic and Sympathomimetic 

Note that the suffix "mimetic" means something that stimulates that part. For instance, a parasympathomimetic drug would be a drug that stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS); a sympathomimetic drug would be one that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. (SNS)

The suffix "lytic" means "breaking down of" or in this case something that stops the function of something. In this case, a sympatholytic drug would be a drug that stops the function of the sympathetic nervous system (and the other does the opposite).

If you wanted to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, then you would either use a:

* parasympathomimetic drug
* sympatholytic drug



## Jeopardy Questions

* Proteins are more complicated so people had thought DNA was contained
