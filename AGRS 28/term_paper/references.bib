  abstract = {The account of law in Plato's Minos is on its surface strange. Law is both what "wants to be the finding out of what is" and "the finding out of what is." It is a faculty in us like sight or hearing, and its stability requires that it be independent of us. It makes universal claims but always does so for a particular people in a particular place. Law must be grounded in what is beyond the law, and yet, once established, must assert its own final authority. Lawgivers must be at once above the law, almost a different species from those for whom they legislate, and, like everyone else, subject to the law. These ambiguities, indeed duplicities, are not so much defects of law to be resolved as indications of its fundamental nature. What follows is an account of this dual nature, especially in its necessary connection to poetry.},

  abstract = {The               \enspace Minos\enspace{}               is said to initiate the natural law tradition because it claims that an unjust law is not truly a law. But the dialogue also shows that reason cannot recognize that a given statute, as such, is a law. Along with this criticism of law, the               \enspace Minos\enspace{}               shows why the Socratic inquiry into law must consider whether divine law is based on a kind of knowledge through which law can be recognized as authoritative. Thanks to the               \enspace Minos,\enspace{}               we see that Plato's               \enspace Laws\enspace{}               begins by examining the kind of knowledge that underlies divine law and that throughout the dialogue the Athenian Stranger is testing whether human reason can know and establish divine law. In the end, the               \enspace Minos\enspace{}               and               \enspace Laws\enspace{}               establish a once influential but now neglected Socratic tradition of inquiry into law.},
