# Lecture 1: Chronology
- Most dates that we know of are approximate, and are derived using radiocarbon dating.
- The bronze age is really where our myths are taking place
    - It's split up into three phases: early middle and late, split up based on the archaeological evidence 
    of the style of pottery produced. 
- There is also a divide in the philosophy of where the gods resided: it used to be the case where they would live 
among humans -- we'll see with Odysseus that he interacts with many of the gods throughout the story. Recently (like 
1000 years ago), this perspective has shifted into the gods residing in their home, living separate from humans.    
- Many of the bronze age centers are where these myths will mostly happen
## Crete
- First state-formed civilization centered around architectural "palaces" formed here.
- Knossos is one of the most famous locations, and goes through many phases of development. 

# Lecture 4
- The Olympians: the gods that live on Olympus
- Consists of Zeus (firstborn, lastborn, then firstborn again), and is considered the law-giver of the 
olympians
    - Consists of two generation: Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, Hestia, Aphrodite. Hestia will be replaced
    Hades is also part of this first generation, but he is not an olympian as he lost the "coin toss" that caused 
    him to rule the underworld. 
    - The second generation: All the children of the first generation: mostly Athena, Hephaestus, Apollo, Artemis, 
    Hermes and later Dionysus. He is the on ewho replaces Hestia. 
- Mount Olympus: highest point in all of Greece, and is usually covered by clouds (also probably why they theorized 
that Gods would live there)
- Most sanctuaries are dedicated to a single deity 
- On the Athenian acropolis: there's the stuff dedicated to Athena, but also smaller sanctuaries for other gods 
too
- Altar of the 12 Gods: where all gods are worshipped at a single location
    - Considered a place of refuge and asylum
    - It's also significant because it served as the geographical center for most things -- people measured 
    distances using this as the relative point of measure. 
- Zeus: there's debate as to whether he is ruled by fate or he commands fate
    - Oversees weather, lightning, gathering of clouds. Shown sometimes to also sit on a throne.  
    - Shown as a mature, older man, also indicated with a beard (generally facial hair) 
    - Longer hair seems to be the style for men 
    - Animals: eagle and the bull -- the bull is actually the only animal that is seen to be fit as a sacrifice 
    to Zeus
    - In charge of law and justice
    - Xenia: means both stranger or guest, generally used to reference hospitality. Also tied to Zeus
    - Father of the gods, but is not free from domestic turmoil 
- Interesting discussion of whether the gods are bound to fate or vice versa. The fates are real figures in 
mythology, so are the gods subservient to them or the other way around?
- There is a lot of middle eastern influence in greek and roman mythology
- Hera: Zeus' wife
    - Representation of the monogamous nature of Greek society
- Io: Argive princess who was priestess of Hera at the sanctuary in Argos
    - Zeus wanted Io, but she resisted. So Zeus raped her instead. Then, he transforms Io into a cow to keep 
    anyone from finding out
    - He commands Argus to keep watch on Io -- Argus is this hundred eyed being who always keeps at least one eye open 
    so that he may watch over Io at all times. 
    - Argus is then killed by Hermes and Io is released 
    - Argus' eyes are "immortalized" in the feathers of the peacock (the bird that represents Hera)
    - Io ends up in Egypt, and is sometimes synonymous with the Egyptian god Isis.
- Europa
    - Zeus comes to Europa as a bull (potentially a Minoan symbol of power), and encourages her to pet him 
    - Zeus then gets her to climb onto his back, and takes her into the ocean. Zeus then just runs into the ocean
    - Europa is brought to Crete, and is considered a foundation myth for the civilization on Crete
    - Her sons are Minos and Radamanthus, both of which will serve as judges in the underworld. 
- Semele
    - Daughter of Cadmus
    - Gives birth to Dionysus
    - She gets Zeus to swear to do anything she wants, which she uses to ask Zeus reveal all of his glory -- something 
    that ultimately gets her killed
    - Zeus ends up saving the fetus, who ends up being Dionysus
    - Zeus puts Dionysus into his thigh so that that birthing process may be complete, which is why Dionysus is also 
    sometimes referred to as twice born
- Festival to Zeus
    - happens once every four years
# Feb. 15 lecture
- Dionysus (Bacchus): after 5th century, his portraits appear younger. Early 5th century, the tradition is more 
that he's shown older
- along with wine, he's also the god of intoxication
- most times wine is actually safer to drink than water, since the alcohol actually "cleanses" the water in some 
sense.
- this is why the god of wine is so important to the Greeks. He's also the god fertility ("life force") -- semen included.  
- also associated with a panther, sometimes spotted
- He's also the god of civilization -- due to his connection to wine. This is mainly because in Greek culture, 
drinking wine is considered a "civilized" activity.  
- remember how Dionysus is born: by being sown into Zeus' thigh. This also gives him the epithet of being "twice-born". 
- Dionysus discovers the art of wine making after being brought to the east to grow up.
- Hera gets to him, and puts him into a fit of madness, under which he ventures to the east
- He becomes an initiate of an eastern goddess, where he learns rituals such as wearing long robes and dancing to music.Through this process, he learns of his true origins and his place in the world as a god.
- Dionysus is the one that gives Midas the ability to turn everything he touches into gold, so in some sense 
he's actually tied to the ideas of not asking for excess.  
- He marries Ariadne, daughter of Minos (from Crete), and takes him to Lemnos.  
- Enthusiasmos: the act of being filled with the god (possessed, if you will). This leads to ekstasis (where we 
get ecstasy from). 
- Maenads are usually shown as being "out of the norm", with hair sorta messy and everything.   
- Male followers: satyrs. They're popular in art, and a lot of vases that are used to store wine have art 
related to Dionysus because why not lol. 
    - they walk upright, have four limbs, have horse or goat hooves 
    - they embody the beastial nature of men
- So he both represents societal norms and also the lack of societal norms: women and men often exhibit nature 
more reminiscent of the opposite sex.   
- In worship, normal sexual limitations are neglected. 
- rejection from his cult
    - arriving from far away --> resistance to his cult 
    - the resistance to his cult is also partly due to the "chaos" he embodies from the wine
- human mutilation due to rejection of dionysus -- potential theme? 
- The Bacchae: another story related to Dionysus' origin story. Pentheus is too strict, too "by the book", and represents
what can be bad about politics and government -- hence he is killed. (too much of anything is bad, common theme 
with dionysus). 
    - Excessive pride is never a good thing, initiation in the cult 
    - Pentheus represents strict government, among some other things?
- His cult appeals mostly to women, and his stories mostly happen in the human world, interacting with actual 
humans. 
- Greater dionysia: 4 days of theatre, where the first three days are dedicated to tragedies and the fourth day was 
performing comedies. 
    - Dionysus, being the god of "losing control" makes sense as the god of theater.
    - some cults of Dionysus actually used masks in order to play different characters.
    - Addition of an actor 
    - Not long before stories became not about Dionysus himself but other great plays    
- Theater sat roughly 17000 people. 
- Heroes play a specific role: by Homer they're considered "noble" figures, and potentially, sometimes considered 
divine. There are several kinds of heroes: Tragic, epic and even heroines.  
- Basic characteristics: divine parent/ancestor, enormous strength/skill, asked to or end up performing impossible feats, trip to the underworld, and a quest for immortality. They will also sometimes act as the intermediary between 
humans and gods. 
- They are a protector from outside forces -- they help protect civilizations by warding off monsters. 
- Paradox: they need these people to keep them safe, but society also can't find a way to control them
- Odysseus, Perseus, Heracles (we'll see this later). 
- Heroines: generally the perfect wife, play the role of , sometimes forced to play out a masculine role
- Tragic hero:  
- Two principles they all strive for: time and Kleos
    - time: honor and respect, earned through having "things", like gemstones and cattle, or control over women, physical deeds (excellence in battle), stealing, athleticism.
    - kleos (fame, glory): basically reputation, poetry and plays as the way that these characters are preserved
    through history.
