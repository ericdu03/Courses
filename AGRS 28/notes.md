# Lecture 1: Chronology
- Most dates that we know of are approximate, and are derived using radiocarbon dating.
- The bronze age is really where our myths are taking place
    - It's split up into three phases: early middle and late, split up based on the archaeological evidence 
    of the style of pottery produced. 
- There is also a divide in the philosophy of where the gods resided: it used to be the case where they would live 
among humans -- we'll see with Odysseus that he interacts with many of the gods throughout the story. Recently (like 
1000 years ago), this perspective has shifted into the gods residing in their home, living separate from humans.    
- Many of the bronze age centers are where these myths will mostly happen
## Crete
- First state-formed civilization centered around architectural "palaces" formed here.
- Knossos is one of the most famous locations, and goes through many phases of development.
