	\section*{Problem 1}
	Here is a list of statements about systems. Determine if each of them is true or false with your justification. 
	\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
		\item If an LTI system is causal, it's stable. 
		\item If a discrete time LTI system has an impulse response \( h[n] \) of finite duration, the system 
			is stable. 
		\item If \( h(t) \) is the impulse response of an LTi system and \( h(t) \) is periodic and non-zero, the 
			system is unstable. 
		\item If \( |h[n]| \le K \) for each \( n \), where \( K \) is a given number, then the LTI system with 
			\( h[n] \) as its ipulse response is stable. 
	\end{enumerate}
