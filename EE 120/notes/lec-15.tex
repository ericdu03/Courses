\section{DT Sampling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Recall what we talked about last time about CT sampling:
		\[
		x_p(t) = x(t) \frac{1}{T}\text{III}\left( \frac{t}{T} \right)  = x(t) f_s \text{III}(tf_s)
		\] 
		and also the fact that we can write \( x_d[n] = x(nT) \), to change the continuous signal into 
		a discrete one. 
\end{itemize}
