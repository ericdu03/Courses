\begin{itemize}
	\item I want to learn more about the kinds of algorithms you employ in MRI research. Obviously you use FFT, but 
		I imagine that your research deals more with the question of ``how can we discern a signal given 
		that it has some known error?''

		I say this becuase I know that there is no other known algorithm that's faster than FFT in terms of 
		computing the Fourier transform. 
	\item Are there other transforms that you use that are perhaps more important than the Fourier transform? 
		From lab I learned about wavelet, is that used more often than FT?
	\item Is there any possibility that I become involved with your research in some capacity over this summer? 
	\item In general, for a student like me: going into their senior year with minimal research experience, 
		what would be your recommendation for me if my goal is to get into grad school and do research?
