However, you can also pass in NumPy arrays and the function will be applied elementwise: `np.sin(np.array([0, np.pi / 2, np.pi, 3 * np.pi / 2]))` will return a numpy array containing $\\sin(0), \\sin(\\pi / 2), \\sin(\\pi), \\sin(3\\pi / 2)$. You can take advantage of this to make your implementation a lot simpler, avoiding the need to iterate over the entire array and manually call the function on each element.\n",

    "## (Optional) Q1d: Pushing the Envelope\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, all the music we've made has sounded robotic. In this part, we'll fix that and make our notes sound like they're coming from an actual instrument! \n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that our model of notes as pure tones is too idealistic — instruments don't produce exact sinusoids at a single frequency with constant amplitude. There are two main differences between our pure tones and how instruments actually work (or at least what most models of them assume):\n",
    "1. **Overtones**. When you play Middle C, you don't just get Middle C. You also get several higher frequencies added in that give instruments a \"richer\" sound than what we've heard so far in this question. These are known as *overtones*. Most instruments are finely tuned so that the only overtones included are the harmonics (integer multiples of the frequency of the note played). So, rather than generating the \"A\" directly below Middle C as a 220 Hz sound, we should also be including the next several harmonics at 440 Hz, 880 Hz, and so on, with the amplitudes dying out as the frequency increases (otherwise, the high-pitched sounds would be unpleasant).\n",
    "2. **Attack and Release Time**. All our notes have been designed to instantly switch between off and on so far: we instantly play the sinusoid at full power as soon as it starts, and then immediately stop it at the end. In actual instruments, there's some delay between the note starting and reaching full volume, known as *attack time*, and then again after it hits a sustained level before the sound completely fades away, called *release time*. The actual times themselves depend on the physical characteristics of the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "You probably have an idea how we could handle (1) — just make a \"chord\" from harmonics of a note every time we want to play it by using our `chord_gen` function, feeding in an array of amplitudes that drops off toward zero for the higher harmonics. The number of harmonics to include, and the rate at which to have the amplitudes drop off depend on the specific instrument being simulated. Generally, more harmonics produces a more \"full\" and organ-like sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking care of (2) is a bit more complicated, however. One of the key developments in electronic music was the invention of the **ADSR Envelope**, which accounts for the non-instant rise and fall times of real instruments. The acronym stands for Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release, and is shown below (image source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music))).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/ADSR.png\" style=\"width:30em\">\n",
    "\n",
    "After constructing an ADSR envelope, call it $w(n)$, we modulate our music signal $x(n)$ with it to produce the signal $y(n) = w(n)x(n)$, which attenuates the sinusoid as appropriate. Again, picking the specific parameters depends on the instrument you want to mimic. To get a feel for what this looks like, run the cell below."

    "# Q3: Fast Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "After making it through this lab, you might be wondering why you should bother with NumPy at all. You may be asking yourself, \"Why can't we just use regular Python lists and the Python math libraries to do everything? They're so much simpler than dealing with NumPy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that NumPy blows vanilla Python out of the water at scientific computing whenever speed is a factor, which it often is (who wants to wait forever for their code to run?). NumPy is your best friend for implementing complex simulations or handling large volumes of data. Anytime you find yourself writing a list comprehension or using loops to do some form of computation, build a habit of converting the code from pure Python to NumPy. It will make everything *much* faster, as you'll see here. NumPy is especially optimized for matrix and vector operations, which are ubiquitous in signal processing algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "All LTI systems — which show up a lot in practical signal processing, and are a lead actor in our course — convolve an input with their impulse response to produce an output in the time domain. This makes it a great case study for us to try and optimize using NumPy. Below, we've provided **working code** to perform a \"full\" mode convolution of two signals without using *any* NumPy functionality. It works by reversing one of the signals and doing a series of sliding dot products, just as you've learned. "

    "Your job in this question is simple: implement the function `numpy_conv` in the next cell to perform a \"full\" mode convolution of the signals `x` and `y`, which will be passed in as numpy arrays. Because we've already given you working code, there are a two requirements:\n",
    "1. Your function must pass all provided test cases below to ensure it's outputting the correct results. Unless this is true, you will automatically get zero points on this question since we've given you working code that passes them.\n",
    "2. Your function must be at least 10x faster than `numpyless_conv` for credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is all or nothing; your solution must satisfy both requirements for credit. For reference, the staff solution is ~20-40x faster (depending on what laptop it's run on) and only makes basic modifications to `numpyless_conv`.\n",

    "**You may not use any NumPy or SciPy functions that automatically perform Fourier Transforms, correlations, or convolutions, as they defeat the entire purpose of this exercise.** However, everything else in NumPy and SciPy is fair game. For example, you're welcome to use `np.dot`, the numpy function that performs dot products and matrix-vector multiplications. If you're unsure about whether or not a function is allowed, just ask on Ed.\n",

    "**Hint:** NumPy is highly optimized for matrix and vector operations. Think about how you could implement convolution in terms of these. You're welcome to start by copying the `numpyless_conv` code and modifying whatever you see fit."
