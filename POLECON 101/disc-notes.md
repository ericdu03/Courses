# Hayek
- "Probably nothing has done as much harm ... [as] the principle of laissez-faire. Yet, in a sense, this was necessary and unavoidable. Yet, in a sense, this was necessary and unavoidable.

# Friedman
- absolutely based opinion


# Brown
- Describing a new way of how neoliberalism has caused people to think
- focused on capital gain
- astrayed from social, political and familial views
- "homoeconomics" to describe this methodology
- try to be good people instead of focusing solely on capitalism
- The argument that poeple are always focused on capital gain seems to overshadow the fact that 
the reason we do this is to stand out from others. 
- emotions are detached, there can be good in climbing the social ladder (e.g. to provide for the 
family)
 



## Brown on Higher Education
- applies chapter 1 to governments
- democracy, subjects, institutional knowledge
- neoliberal framework: hyper-rational modes of being undermine the humanistic roots of democratic 
institutions.
- very specific to higher education thanks to the neoliberal framework

# Klein
- Introduction
    - Friedman's shock doctrine: when there is disaster (a coup, a weather disaster, terrorism attack), there is opportunity
    - the relationship between shock doctrine and keynesianism
- a bit nitpicky

## Chapter 3 of Klein
- Chilean government and shock after military coup (Pinochet's rise). Can you push the free market 
reforms out? - case study of chile
- Chilean growth was seen as a utopian free market, there was hyperinequality however. 
- things that seemed like a good success were actually failures.
- disregards people living in areas living in sustained damages due to catastrophes - wait what kinds 
of alternatives exist for such a process? 
    - If a massive shock occurs, 

# Week 7 - Financialization
## Financialization
- making profit for the sake of making profit
- making profits through the movement of money (finance, investing, etc.)
    - contrast this with the production of goods 
- investments: how an average person can earn money without relying on production of goods
- Now more people just own stocks - less than 9% of people owned any form of stock, but nowadays over 50% are invested 
in funds 
    - The types of things you can be invested in as well have grown
    - Changes the culture and careers that people can go into (people no longer have to rely on corporations)

## Copernican Revolution
- The shift from corporations into the individual being able to participate in financial markets
- in the early 1900s it was possible to work for one large corporation (and that corporation would be the thing you'd organize your life around). Your well-being is tied to the health of the company
- after financialization you're no longer tied to that one company, we are now tied to the stock market
**find copernican revolution** 

## Efficient Markets Hypothesis
- prices of assets are reflective of all the information of that asset
- even if it's not perfect, it's the best thing we have (there's so much information that the price system is the most accurate way of gathering imperfect information into a metric)
- if price goes up = you're doing something well, price goes down, etc.
- governments try to encourage this behavior
- governments become suppliers as well - they are suppliers of laws
    - different governments around the world compete against one another for the occupation of companies 

# Schumpeter
- If growth of output continues for the next 50 years at the same rate that it had since the last 50, output would
increase by about 2% per year - if that same growth persisted, then over 50 years everybody's total income would double, and the government would have enough wealth to basically pay for the effects of unemployment. People 
would be able to remain employed (they could pay those costs over) 
    - Employment under capitalism is also cyclical. Unemployment wasn't really a big concern. 
- perfect competition doesn't really exist - we're in perpetual state of warfare against one another against innovation and tech advancements
- Creative destruction is powered by entrepreneurs - they are creating innovations that destroy older market
- implies that the introduction of something new necessitates the destruction of something else
  - Examples: netflix vs. blockbuster, steam vs. gamestop, technology vs. notebooks
- Market of electric/eco-friendly vehicles vs. old gas vehicles
- why is this new?
  - economists tend to think of innovation as competition rather than taking over
  - Traditional economists believe in static things - they don't explain how markets transition
  - capitalism would eventually optimize and equalize at somepoint 
- **capitalism is doomed**
   - Instead of optimizing on markets, capitalism encourages the creation of new markets entirely that disrupt previous markets - this is the main concern for him rather than the creation of competition
   - They assume that the markets wouldn't really go anywhere 
   - it would inevitably be replaced by socialism
   - capitalism tends to generate discontent
   - people were stupid and don't know how to take care of the system
1. not much of a populist - ppl aren't rational - even if you confront those who oppose capitalism with clear evidence that capitalism works, their anger toward the system isn't rational 
2. People lack long-run indexing. They don't think long enough into the future - capitalism only works only if you think about it in the long run. Right now, it's difficult to see reward right now
3. lack of social attachment to the market (the capitalist order)
4. People will take capitalism for granted. That growth is granted and they will benchmark it against. due to the vast inequality, people will be more upset about the things they don't have as opposed to what they're getting

# Mazzucato
- the state takes greater risks with the private sector 
- trying to do something more difficult than what private businesses do
- coal: coal-fired power plants are on the decline. The government invests in this industry to preserve the jobs, even though they know it's a failing thing
- Investing in touchscreen
- private companies will move in after the state - because the government is more insultaed from risk, they don't have investors they need to satisfy 
- they don't invest in the early stages when they can visualize the profit that is generally lower risk - this requires the government to go first
