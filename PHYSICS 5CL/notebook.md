# Introductory lecture notes

- report the error down to one significant figure (e.g. $2.3 \pm 0.7$)
- Formatting: $3.2 \pm 0.1$ cm is an okay way to report your measurements, don't need to put "cm" on both sides

- sometimes the quality fo the equipment doesn't allow you to measure to the precision that is allowed traditionally by instruments of that type. (e.g. using a beaten ruler to make a measurement should have a higher unceratinty relative to a pristine ruler )

# Lab 1

## Calibration
To calibrate the laser, we made sure that the reflected ray coincides with the incident ray


## Experiment 2


### Verifying Precision 

The laser was moved horizontally left and right on the railing, and the position of the image did not change. Thus the laser is calibrated.



# Lab 2: Polarization

Polarisers were accurate in their markings for the direction. When they were placed at 90 degree angular separation, no light passed through. 

## Experiment 2.1: Calibration of Quarter Wave Plate

To determine fast axis two polarizers are set up at an angle separation of $90^\circ$, and QWP placed in between it. If fast axis is aligned with either polarizer, the QWP should do nothing. Fast axis is also assumed to be aligned with the markings on the QWP. 

QWP 2 seems to be slightly off of its calibration by approx 7.5 degrees relative to the markings the QWP. 

## Experiment 2.2: Observations of circularly polarized light

We're using the laser because it's already partially linearly polarized, so we guarantee that light coming out of the polarizer is *more* linearly polarized than had we started with a source with all propagation directions like a normal lamp. 

~~Laser is at 17,000 lux initially, and about 9,000 lux after 1 polarizer, down to 6,900 lux after polarizer and quarter wave plate.~~

Laser initially at 14800 lux, 10020 lux with polariser, and 8256 lux with polariser + QWP
- there is some fluctuation in the readings, but they are roughly accurate down to 10 lux. 
- we used the 0-150,000 lux mode because that's the only way we can get these readings.
- intensity of the polarizer varies between 2143 lux and 1214 lux.
  - there seems to be some type of sinusoidal relationship between the two. 
- not sure whether polariser 2 is supposed to match wiht QWP 2, but we did polariser 1 and QWP 2. Don't think it should matter though.


## Experiment 2.3: circular polarisation filters

Polariser 1 and polariser 2 are placed on either end, with angular separation of 90 degrees. QWP 1 was placed at angle 45 degrees relative to the vertical, counterclockwise looking from the laser. QWP 2 was placed at an angle approx 37.5 degrees clockwise from the laser. 
- this configuration produced the minimum intensity on the screen

- when QWP and polariser were rotated by 30 degrees, it does not act as a left circularly polarizing filter anymore. It's close to the minimum intensity, but not exactly at that intensity (rotating polariser 2 by 1 degree less would get you the minimum intensity).


when QWP 2 and polariser 2 are moved simultaneously the intensity of the dot is at a minimum at the previously measured configuration, but grows stronger to a peak and then dies off before rotating 180 degrees. When rotated 180 degrees, we recovered the original setup (this makes sense since it was "flip", or rotation by 180 degrees.)


## Experiment 3: Brewster's Angle

Laser is vertically polarised, so we circularly polarise it first by passing it through a quarter wave plate. This changes the light to be circularly polarised. Then we pass it through another linear polariser to get p-polarised light (light is now polarised in the plane of the incident and reflected rays). Then we pass it thorugh a glass, and record the angle of incident. out 36 degrees.  

# Lab 3: Diffraction

The fringes look like thick sets of horizontal line segments (larger on the top and bottom than in the middle) arranged vertically. The fringes mimic this behavior, except they appear horizontally to the left and right, but the intensity of each is less and decays the further out we are. The length of each segment also decreases. This makes sense according to our theory.

## 1.2 Modifying the lens 

Note that we weren't able to the light to pass clean through the center of the diverging lens


# Lab 4 

## Experiment 2: Spectrometer
- positive distance is defined as to the right of the central maximum, as observed from the perspective of our eye 
  - right central maximum was extremely difficult to read
  - to perform a measurement we used the slides on the spectrometer and measured the center of the maximum 
- the maxima appeared very wide, so obtaining a precise measurement was difficult. As such, our uncertainty also reflects the width of the observed band.
- Distance between grating and spectrometer scale: 27.2 cm


- The diffraction pattern was fatter in the center than they were at the edges - we measured the fattest point so that we could cover the entire spectrum

## Experiment 5: Photocurrent vs. intensity
minimum intensity for the laser is at L015


# Lab 5: Atomic Spectra

## Experiment 1: Helium

Helium vaccuum tube appeared a light purple color

We can see a diffraction pattern on either side, one to the left and to the right of the center slit. Yellow band was much closer to orange than it was to yellow. The diffraction pattern isn't exactly a clean one - this is likely due to imperfections in the vaccuum tube. 

# Lab 6: Calorimetry

**Remember that only write up two of four experiments.**

## Experiment 1: Basic Calorimetry

Took two reservoirs of water at different temperatures, poured them into one another and recorded the temperature change over time. Temperature was measured until it was constant.


## Experiment 2: Latent Heat of Fusion

Collect some ice in a styrofoam cup, then pour a known amount of warm water at a known temperature inside, and measure the final temperature.
