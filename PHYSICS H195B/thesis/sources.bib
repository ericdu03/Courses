  abstract = {English and Spanish translations are provided for Fritz Zwicky's seminal article on "The Redshift of Extragalactic Nebulae", published in German in Helvetica Physica Acta in 1933 . This paper is usually cited as the first evidence for dark matter ("dunkle Materie", not "missing matter"). Zwicky's conclusion is based on the velocity dispersion of only seven galaxies in the Coma cluster of galaxies. Now, 84 years later, with 1000+ radial velocities measured for Coma cluster members, Coma's velocity dispersion is very close to that found by Zwicky. The translation is as literal as possible, and annotations on the translation of certain terms are given. Doubts on the meaning of the original phrasing are given in square brackets at a few places where they occur. The pdf version of my English translation was kindly prepared by Cren Frayer at the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), also available at NED's Level5 repository since June 2017 (). A Spanish translation, without figures, prepared by myself with the help of Martha Margarita López Gutiérrrez is appended within the same pdf file. As translator I take responsibilty for the quality of the translation.},

So far, numerous efforts have been made to search for particle DM, and yet none has yielded an unambiguous observation of DM particles.},

  abstract = {Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) provide a promising solution to the problem of producing large format arrays of ultra sensitive detectors for astronomy. Traditionally KIDs have been constructed from superconducting quarter-wavelength or half-wavelength resonator elements capacitivly coupled to a co-planar feed line. Photons are detected by measuring the change in quasi-particle density caused by the splitting of Cooper pairs in the superconducting resonant element. This change in quasi-particle density alters the kinetic inductance, and hence the resonant frequency of the resonant element. This arrangement requires the quasi-particles generated by photon absorption to be concentrated at positions of high current density in the resonator. This is usually achieved through antenna coupling or quasi-particle trapping. For these detectors to work at wavelengths shorter than around 500 μm where antenna coupling can introduce a significant loss of efficiency, then a direct absorption method needs to be considered. One solution to this problem is the Lumped Element KID (LEKID), which shows no current variation along its length and can be arranged into a photon absorbing area coupled to free space and therefore requiring no antennas or quasi-particle trapping. This paper outlines the relevant microwave theory of a LEKID, along with theoretical performance for these devices.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new wire-bond free technique for suppressing slot-line mode excitation in coplanar waveguides (CPWs) bends. The suppression of slot-line mode is obtained by applying a slow wave structure to the shorter slot of the right-angle bend. The structure is modified into a circular-shaped bend where the slow wave compensation is then used to equalize the electrical length of the inner and outer slots. The insertion loss of the modified CPW bend with slow wave structure is evaluated on a silicon substrate and is similar to straight CPW lines with return loss ( 11) values below 20 dB over a 50-GHz bandwidth.},

  abstract = {Transition Edge Sensors (TESs) are amongst the most sensitive cryogenic detectors and can be easily optimized for the detection of massive particles or photons ranging from X-rays all the way down to millimetre radiation. Furthermore, TESs exhibit unmatched energy resolution while being easily frequency domain multiplexed in arrays of several hundred pixels. Such great performance, along with rather simple and sturdy readout and amplification chains make TESs extremely compelling for applications in many fields of scientific endeavour. While the first part of this article is an in-depth discussion on the working principles of Transition Edge Sensors, the remainder of this review article focuses on the applications of Transition Edge Sensors in advanced scientific instrumentation serving as an accessible and thorough list of possible starting points for more comprehensive literature research.},
