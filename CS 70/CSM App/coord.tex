	\item I think having had 2 semesters of experience as an SM has allowed me to fully understand the dynamics

	\item I want to also be a source of guidance to more people, and I think there are still a lot of 
		changes that can be made in order to increase the quality of teaching we provide. 

		Interconnectedness is very important in CSM, and I think a large part of that is being able to improve the 
		JM experience. Ever since the exec meeting I've been thinking about how I could imporve the JM experience, and

		CSM.

		This is one thing I felt that was particularly lacking in CSM when I was a JM, and I don't believe that it's 
		improved very much since then. One thing that could help is to give JMs more ways to interact with 
		other SMs, and make them feel like they truly do matter when it comes to the collaborative effort
