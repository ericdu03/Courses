\chapter{Introduction}
Welcome to my notes for CS 70! When I took this class, one of the things I noticed pretty early on was the common 
dissatisfaction with the way the course notes are written, as they are very dense and make heavy use of 
mathematical language that the reader may not be immediately familiar with. So, my goal with this book 
is to try and strip away all that technical language, and present the material in a way that hopefully makes 
more sense. 

I have to thank my good friend Andrew Binder for his style file: he is largely the reason why I undertook this 
endeavor to begin with.    
\section{How you should use these notes}
Throughout the notes, I will try to be as comprehensive as possible, but at the end of the day, these notes are 
simply meant to be supplementary reading to official course material. It is also entirely possible 
that the notation used in this book differs from that used in the course, and if you find that happening 
make sure you use the official notation.  
 
Also, my goal with this book is not to be as mathematically rigorous as possible, but instead to present the material 
in a way that practically makes sense -- I want you to walk away from each section feeling like you have the ability 
to utilize the concepts from that section to solve new problems.

One last thing before we dive into the content, let's go over the elements in this book and what they mean:
% theorems, remarks, warnings, stuff like that
