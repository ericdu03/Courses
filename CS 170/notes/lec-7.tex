\section{Strongly Connected Graphs}
	Recall that we saw earlier that DFS basically just calls explore repeatedly, to find all the vertices 
	reachable from a vertex $u$. We also introduced two clocks, where when we first visit a node 
	we stamp it with the start clock, and that vertex will have a $\pre(u)$ quantity that stores its value, 
	then increments clock. When we leave the vertex, we stamp again with a $\post(u)$. 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item For cross edges (the only thing we didn't finish last time), we have $\pre(v) < \post(v) <
			\pre(u) < \post(u)$ (we get to $v$ and finish exploring $v$ before we ever touch $u$).
		\item As a recap:
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{c|c}
					Edge type & Relation\\
					\hline
					Tree edge & $\pre(u)< \pre(v) < \post(v) < \post(u)$\\
					Back edge & $\pre(v) < \pre(u) < \post(u) < \post(v)$\\
					Cross edge & $\pre(v) < \post(v) < \pre(u) < \post(u)$
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
	\end{itemize}


	\subsection{Topological Sort} 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The process of finding an ordering of vertices so that no edges go backwards. This is used 
			in software package loading, to make sure that things aren't being and that are being downloaded
			in the chronological order. 
		\item Mathematically, if $u$ comes before $v$ in the ordering, then there is no edge $(v, u)$. 
		\item Two types of special nodes: \textbf{sources} and \textbf{sinks}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{Source:} A node that has no incoming edges and has only outgoing edges. 
				\item \textbf{Sink:} A node that has no outgoing edges and only has incoming edges
			\end{itemize}
		\item Note that a node with no edge at all is considered both a source and a sink.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{DAGs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Called a directed acyclic graph, or basically just a graph without any directed cycles. If 
			we have a cycle, then we can't toplogically sort. 
		\item We will find that if we run DFS on a graph, it is a DAG iff it has no back edges.
			We prove that if we have a back edge, then it cannot be a DAG: since they go from something 
			that's already been visited to something that's been visited earlier, then we have already 
			found a cycle. 

			Now we prove that if we don't have a DAG (i,e, has a cycle) , then it has a back edge. Since DFS
			visits every vertex in 
			a graph, it will eventually enter our cycle at some $v_i$. Then, it will traverse through the cycle
			until it visits all the nodes and eventually gets to $v_k$, the node right before it comes back to 
			$v_i$. 
			Then, $v_k \to v_i$ will become a back edge, since it was visited earlier in the graph.
		\item Back edges are really special! Recall that we only have a back edge when $\post(u) < \post(v)$, 
			since the other edges have $\post(v) < \post(u)$. We then conclude that if we have a DAG, then 
			it has the property that $\post(v) < \post(u)$ (since it can't have back edges). 
			
			\question{Does 
				the logic work the other way around? Does 
			this mean that if $\post(u) < \post(v)$ then we have a DAG?}

			\answer{Not necessarily. Just because $\post(v) > \post(u)$ doesn't necessarily imply that a 
			back edge exists.}
		\item Our algorithm for topological sort: do a DFS on graph $G$, then enumerate all $v \in V$ in 
			the decreasing order of $\post(v)$. 
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Strongly Connected Components}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item To find DAGs on undirected graphs we can run DFS on them, but what about directed graphs? 
		\item \textbf{Definition:} Vertices $u$ and $v$ are strongly connected if there is a path from $u$ to 
			$v$ and there is also a path from $v$ to $u$. 
		\item A graph is \textit{strongly connected} when all of its vertices are strongly connected.
		\item Generally, we partition a graph into \textit{strongly connected components}, since it's very rare
			that the 
			entire graph is strongly connected.
		\item Strong connectivity is an example of an equivalence relationship, since it satisfies all 
			the properties: reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Every vertex is strongly connected to itself
				\item If $A$ is strongly connected to $B$, then $B$ is strongly connected to $A$. 
				\item If $A$ is strongly connected to $B$ and $B$ is strongly connected to $C$, then $A$ 
					is strongly connected to $C$.
			\end{itemize}
		\item If we flip all the edge (i.e. reverse the direction), the strongly connected components don't 
			change at all! 
		\item We can then divide this into a \textit{meta graph}, where we group the graph by strongly 
			connected components (try to be as general as possible when you do this).
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The meta graph can't have cycles! Had a cycle existed, then it would imply that vertices 
					from one strongly connected component can reach vertices of another, and vice versa!
				\item Therefore, the meta graph \textit{must} be a DAG.
			\end{itemize}
		\item Why care about SCC? It is useful in many different fields, since SCCs naturally imply 
			a strong equivalence of objects in a graph.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Finding SCCs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Attempt 1:} Consider all possible decompositions and check (BAD!)
		\item \textbf{Attempt 2:} Consider pairs of nodes, then run explore to see if they reach the other. 
			(ALSO BAD!)
		\item There exists an algorithm that runs this in $O(n + m)$ time, where we have to run DFS (smartly) 
			only twice!
	\end{itemize}
	\subsubsection{More Properties of SCCs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It actually matters where we start our DFS, since sometimes we can't exit the particular 
			connected component. Specifically, if the node is part of a source in the meta graph, then 
			it will visit many nodes, whereas if the node is a sink then we never exit that particular connected
			component.
		\item The ``right'' place to start the DFS is in the \textbf{sink of the meta graph!} The key 
			thing is that we shouldn't exit that connected component, so running \texttt{explore()} on 
			any vertex within this CC will give us the whole SCC.
		\item \textbf{Idea:} Do the topological sort on the meta graph, then run DFS on the sinks of 
			the meta graph.
		\item Suppose we run DFS on a graph $G$. Let $C$ and $C'$ be two connected components such that $C \to 
			C'$ in the meta graph. Then, $\max(\post(v \in C)) > \max(\post(u \in C'))$.

			\textit{Proof:} Split into cases, based on where in the graph we started:

			Case 1: Suppose DFS visited $C$ first ($u \in C$ is the first node visited by DFS. Then, 
			DFS will explore $C'$ first before finishing its exploration of $C$. This means that DFS finishes
			$C'$ before finishing $C$, meaning that $\max(\post(v \in C)) > \max(\post(u \in C'))$.

			Case 2: Suppose DFS visited $C'$ first. Then, we will never visit $C$ since there is no directed
			edge between $C' \to C$. Therefore, the post of $C'$ stops before DFS even reaches $C$, Hence, 
			we have $\max(\post(u \in C')) < \max(\post(v \in C))$. 
		\item Immediate corollary of this: Suppose we ran DFS on a graph $G$. The highest $\post(v)$ belongs 
			to a node $v$ that is in the source SCC of the meta graph!
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Imagine $\max(\post(C))$ is not the largest $\post(v)$ value. Then, this means that 
					there exists another $C''$ whose $\post(C'')$ is larger than that of $C$!
			\end{itemize}
		\item So now we have a way of finding the source of the vertices in $C$, but we want to start from 
			sinks, so we \textbf{flip the edges, then run DFS!} The only difference betweeh $G$ and $G^R$ (the 
			reversed graph) is the direction of the edges; the connected components remain the same.

			\question{Instead of flipping edges, why not run the algorithm from the minimum post value 
			instead?}

			\answer{Because the minimum isn't guaranteed to be a SCC in the same way the max is.}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{The Algorithm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compute $G^R$.
		\item Run DFS on $G^R$.
		\item Store the post numbers of this DFS in array called post-r 
		\item Run DFS on $G$, but explore unvisited nodes in \textit{decreasing} order of post-r. For every 
			DFS we run, we find a new SCC.
	\end{itemize}
